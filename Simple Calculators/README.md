# Python Program to Make a Simple Calculator

Here we will be making a simple calculator in which we can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

## Python Program to Make a Simple Calculator

Create a simple calculator which can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division depending upon the user input. Approach :

User chooses the desired operation. Options 1, 2, 3, and 4 are valid. Two numbers are taken and an if…elif…else branching is used to execute a particular section.
Using functions add(), subtract(), multiply() and divide() evaluate respective operations.

GUI of a Calculator Which will help to add, subtract , Multiply and divide

## Python | Distance-time GUI calculator using Tkinter

Python offers multiple options for developing GUI (Graphical User Interface). Out of all the GUI methods, tkinter is most commonly used method. It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with tkinter outputs the fastest and easiest way to create the GUI applications. Creating a GUI using tkinter is an easy task.

To create a tkinter :

    - Importing the module – tkinter
    - Create the main window (container)
    - Add any number of widgets to the main window
    - Apply the event Trigger on the widgets.

Let’s create a GUI based Distance-Time calculator using Python Tkinter module, which can tell distance between two city / location and time taken in travelling from one location to another location .

Modules required:
- tkinter
- requests
- json

## Python – Compound Interest GUI Calculator using Tkinter

Python offers multiple options for developing a GUI (Graphical User Interface). Out of all the GUI methods, Tkinter is the most commonly used method. In this article, we will learn how to create a Compound Interest GUI Calculator application using Tkinter, with a step-by-step guide.
 

To create a Tkinter: 

    Importing the module – tkinter
    Create the main window (container)
    Add any number of widgets to the main window.
    Apply the event Trigger on the widgets.

## Scientific GUI Calculator using Tkinter in Python

We are going to create GUI Scientific Calculator using Python. As you can see, calculating large numbers nowadays is difficult or time-consuming. We’ve created a simple Scientific Calculator GUI using Python that allows you to perform simple and complex calculations. To implement GUI we will use the Tkinter module of Python.

### Stepwise Implementation

**Step 1:** Import module <br>
**Step 2:** Here we will create geometry or a so-called layout for the GUI of the calculator by using Tkinter.
<br>**Step 3:** Now we will create a class in which we will create all the functions of the scientific calculator so that they can be called and perform easily.
<br>**Step 4:** The below code will create a display in the GUI of the calculator by passing the font style, font size, background color, foreground color as an argument inside the entry function. 
<br>**Step 5:** Here we will create a number pad for the calculator. 
<br>**Step 6:** Now we will place all the buttons/operators in their respective position in the grid. This is up to you to set them as per your choice by changing their row and column value. In this, each button function is just taking the name of the operator, width, height, background, foreground, font, and respective column & row position of the button as an argument. 
<br>**Step 7:** Now at last we will create a menubar of the calculator GUI.
